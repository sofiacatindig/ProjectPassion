<h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>
        Metacognition is a section dedicated to a self-crafted process <br>
        that teaches students how to practice metacognition through active <br>
        data evaluation. It is turning passion and purpose into a plan. It is a <br>
        series of articles that explains why an iterative improvement cycle is <br>
        necessary for achieving goals, the steps in the process, areas and variables, <br>
        and how to start. I hope to create an AI that streamlines this process in <br>
        the future, as it already has a lot of similarities in terms of pattern <br>
        identification and data evaluation which I discuss in the Future Lens section.
